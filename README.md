# Next.js node-fetch Error in getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using `node-fetch` within the `getServerSideProps` function in Next.js.  The issue arises from the incorrect import of `node-fetch`.

## Problem
The provided code uses `import fetch from 'node-fetch';` within a `getServerSideProps` function. This approach is incorrect.  Next.js's `getServerSideProps` runs on the server-side, where `node-fetch` is expected to be available.  However, the import is not correctly configured.  The error message usually indicates that 'fetch' is not a function.

## Solution
The solution is to correct the import and ensure that `node-fetch` is properly installed as a dependency.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.

You will observe the error message.

## Solution Implemented
The solution is provided in the `bugSolution.js` file.  It correctly imports `node-fetch` and demonstrates the functionality.
